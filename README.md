# Alpano

## Contributors
This project was done with @robinmamie for the [Object Oriented Programming](https://cs108.epfl.ch/archive/17/) class @ EPFL.

## Goal

The goal of the Alpano project is to draw Alps Panoramas with annotated summits. The user can choose his/her location and the direction of his/her choice.
The project uses a dataset collected by the [SRTM](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission) mission (Nasa) to model the ground relief as well as a ray tracing algorithm to simulate lights and draw the panorama.

Here is an example of panorama drawing:

And the corresponding real picture:
